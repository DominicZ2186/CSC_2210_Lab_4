### Directions to Run the Game:

- Make sure you have CLion installed on your machine
- If you do not, you can install it here: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows

### How to Enter Debug Mode:

- Before starting the game, the system will ask you whether you want to play the game in debug mode or not
- Answering 'y' puts the user in debug mode
- Answering 'n' doesn't put the user in debug mode
- Answering anything else will result in the system asking for a valid input until a valid input is given
